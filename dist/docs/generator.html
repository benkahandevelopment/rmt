<h1>Generator</h1>
<p>The Generator is a tool for creating a concise, formatted post-match thread. This post is not meant for editing and shreds any unnecessary macros in the post.</p>
<p>These are the steps to generate a post-match thread:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to a Match Thread post that was created from the <span class="rmt-br">rMT</span> tool</li>
    <li>Click "edit" or "source" to view the complete text including reddit markup, and copy it to the clipboard</li>
    <li>Visit the <mark><i class="fas fa-upload"></i> Generator</mark> tab</li>
    <li>Paste in the Match Thread into the top textarea, and click <code>Generate</code></li>
    <li>The output in the second textarea is the complete source code for your Post-Match Thread. You can paste it into a new post by clicking <code>Copy to Keyboard</code></li>
</ol>
