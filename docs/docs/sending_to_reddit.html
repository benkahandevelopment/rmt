		<h1>Sending to Reddit</h1>
		<p>Currently, the method by which the extension works is to <strong>speed up</strong> (not automate) the process of updating match threads. As such, the tool searches for macros placed within the body of your post and replaces it with relevant text formatted with <em>reddit</em> markdown.</p>
		<p class="alert alert-info">As this tool is in beta, there are no safeguards against when and where on <em>reddit</em> you can use the <code>Save &amp; Update Post</code> button. Therefore, it is recommend you only use the tool when the current tab is on a post you have already posted that you wish to update.</p>
